# Lecture 12: Sales and Marketing 

Can we turn it up a little bit so it has more pump up? Okay, there we go. Okay. Guys, we have to find the beat then clap to the beat. Okay, please stop the music. Please put on the presentation. Thank you. That will be about the most pumped up thing that happens in enterprise software. The rest is downhill from here. Thank you for that well rehearsed intro.

我們能放段音樂嗎？好的
能大點聲嗎？更帶感點
好的
動起來吧
我們跟著節奏打一下拍子
好了謝謝放音樂的同學
把音樂停了吧謝謝
把音樂停了吧謝謝
幫忙把ppt調出來吧謝謝
這是企業軟件這次講座
最帶感的部分
後面的就“走下坡路”了
謝謝大家剛才的配合
的確很好

I’m Aaron Levie, CEO and co-founder of Box. Welcome to this edition on how to build an enterprise software company. This is my understanding, this is the course you are taking? Is that correct? No.
我叫Aaron Levie 是Box公司的CEO和聯合創始人
歡迎大家參加
如何打造企業軟件公司係列講座
我是這麼理解的
這才是你們所參加的講座的主題對吧？
不是？
So this is my job today. I am going to try and convince you that everyone else that speaks during this whole class is wrong and that you actually want to build an enterprise software company. Hopefully we will be able to work through this and you'll have a good sense of why it's super cool to be in enterprise. And why the perceptions of going into the consumer space, why it's so much fun are wrong, and why you want to go into enterprise software. Who wants to build an enterprise software company? Good, alright. Thank you very much. Hopefully we will do a vote at the end and hopefully that will not have shrunk. That's really the only goal I have today.

我今天的任務是
說服你們
剛才說“不是”的那些人都是錯的
你們其實是想創建企業軟件公司的
希望大家能夠接受
希望你們能體會到
為什麼投身企業軟件領域是很酷的
為什麼大家普遍認為
投身消費者軟件行業
很有趣神馬的
為什麼這是不對的為什麼你們應該創建企業軟件公司
有多少同學想創建企業軟件公司？
好的謝謝大家的支持
希望本講座結束時再做個調查
舉手的人數不會減少
我今天的目的就是鼓勵大家投身企業軟件行列
So we are going to talk about three things today. The first is the quick background of Box. Because when we first started out, we did not know we wanted to do enterprise software. So I want to go a little bit into why we went after enterprise and what we do today. Then we are going to talk the major factors that changed in enterprise software that make it possible to do a startup today. And finally we are going to look at patterns that are ways to recognize and go build a startup by yourself. Hopefully, that will be some practical, useful advice. Just as a forewarning, my voice, I've been speaking a lot the past few days. So hopefully I will be able to get to that third part of advice and make it.
今天我主要講三個方面
首先快速回顧一下B​​ox的創業史
因為我們創業時
並非想創立企業軟件公司
所以我想給大家講一下為什麼
我們決定躋身企業軟件行列以及目前我們的業務
接著我會講一下
企業軟件行業的哪些大變化
使得目前在該行業創業
變得可能
最後講一下
可以藉鑑的模式
一些創建企業軟件公司的方法
希望大家能覺得實用有效
先聲明一下
最近幾天我說了太多話
但願講到第三點時
還能說出聲來
試試看吧
Building for the enterprise, these are high level stats of Box. We have about two hundred forty thousand businesses that use Box, there are over twenty-seven million users that have brought Box into their organization, and ninety-nine percent of Fortune 500s. Actually that one percent is really Microsoft and they don't seem to want to buy from us. We have to work on that a little bit. A lot of users to bring Box into workplace environments, these are some of the organizations that are using the product. We have a very wide range of industries from manufacturing consumer products to companies like General Electric. Stanford Health Care actually uses the product for collaboration inside the medical department search. Between health care, media, manufacturing, these are some of the range of industries we serve.

我們今天要講的是創建面向企業的公司
先說一下我們Box的情況
目前約有24萬家公司使用我們的產品
有超過2700萬人
在他們公司或所屬組織中使用我們的產品
其中99%的用戶來自世界500強
剩下的1%是微軟
他們不想買我們的產品
我們還得再接再厲啊
有各種類型的公司使用我們的產品
很多公司的員工把我們的產品帶人他們公司
這張ppt展示了部分使用我們產品的公司
涉及範圍很廣
從製造業公司
像通用電氣這樣的公司
到斯坦福保健部門使用我們的產品
用於加強醫院內以及科研間的合作
我們提供服務的公司
涉及醫療媒體製造業


So the question is, how did we get here? Because we didn't start the company to be an enterprise software company even though that is how things ended up happening. We launched the company in 2005, we got the idea back in college which was 2004. Was anybody using the internet back in 2004? Okay great. I didn't know if millennials used the internet or not, so great. Sorry, okay no more age jokes. Okay here is the point. So back in 2004, you might remember there wasn't a lot to do back then. It was boring right? This was before Facebook, this is certainly before Snapchat, so before much to do. You couldn't send people fifteen second messages or photos that disappeared because you didn't even have phones. So on the internet, in 2004, there wasn't a lot going on. This is sort of what the internet looked like, a barren deserted landscape. Just to clarify, the happy camel is Google, the sad camel is Yahoo! This is the internet in 2004. Yahoo! has done a lot better since then, but back in the mid 2004, they were trying to find their way. And Google was taking over the world. But this was the extent of the entire world.
那麼我們是怎麼做到目前的規模的呢？
我們當初開始創業時
並非想創建企業軟件公司
儘管目前是這樣的
我們是在2005年創建公司發布產品的
2004年我們還在大學時有了這個創意
在2004年有多少人上網？好的
不知道2000年時大家上不上網
好啦不再開這方面的玩笑了
說重點
回顧2004年
你們可能還記得當時上網也沒什麼可做的
有點無聊當時還沒有Facebook
當然也沒有Snapchat
沒有很多有意思的事情可做
不能給對方發消息或照片
在15秒後消失
甚至沒有可以給對方發照片的手機
2004年上網還不火
互聯網就像這幅圖一樣
有點荒涼
互聯網就如這片荒涼的沙漠一般
不過有開心的Google和不悅的Yahoo
這幅圖挺形象的
這就是2004年的互聯網
現在Yahoo有起色多了
不過當時
他們公司在夾縫中尋生存
Google獨領風騷
這就是當時的情況
So what we noticed in 2004, in college, was for some reason it was really hard to share files. And as simple of an idea as that is now, and you go back ten years. It was either really expensive or really hard to move data around through corporate companies. I had an internship at the time, most of my job using data was to copy printed out papers and put them in cabinets. That's what you do as an intern if you are not a computer science guy. So I was really really good at copying paper, unfortunately not a skill really used today. But it was really hard to share files. In classroom environments, you were working in large groups, it was also hard to share files. I went to USC, and USC gave you fifty megabytes of storage space. Fifty megabytes, you can basically store one file. Then it would auto delete every six months. So whoever was running IT at the time, they certainly weren't running hard drives. And so it was really, really hard to store and share files. Well, why don't we make it easy to store and share files from anywhere?
2004年我們還在讀大學的時候
我們注意到
當時分享文件不怎麼容易
雖然現在挺容易的
10年前的話要麼很貴
要麼數據很難從一家公司的網絡中移到另一家
當時我找了份實習工作
工作中使用數據的話就從紙質資料上抄下來
再把資料放回櫃子裡
如果你們不是計算機專業學生的話
你們也得這麼幹
我當時很擅長抄寫
不過現在的話這項技能不怎麼有用了
當時分享資料不容易
在班裡
需要經常和很多同學合作
分享資料不方便
我當時上的是南加大
南加大分給每個同學
50M的​​郵件存儲空間
只有50M
差不多只能存一個文件
而且每六個月文件自動清除
不知道當時誰在負責IT這塊
顯然他們沒買夠硬盤
總之很難存儲和分享文件
所以我們就想
為什麼我們不
讓存儲和分享文件變得簡單呢？
So we got the idea for, at the time, Box.net. And what we noticed was, there were a lot of factors that changed in the software world. The first was the cost of storage was dropping dramatically. So in our business, basically every year or two you could double the amount of storage and data goes into a hard drive. So what was uneconomical now because feasible. The cost of computing, the cost of storage has dropped. We had more powerful browsers, and networks. Firefox was just emerging. People were using the much faster internet for homes and the classroom. Then people had more locations that they wanted to store and share information with. So we had these three factors that were sort of emerging. So pull these factors back when I give some tactical advice. The first point to remember, always look for the changing technology factors. Every market that has a significant change in underlying were enabling factors was in an environment that was about to change in a very significant way. We were very fortunate in the need for data in the Cloud, was growing in importance. The cost and feasibility. was also not improving rapidly. We decided to put together this really quick version of Box and launched it as Box.net. The idea was, let's make it really easy to share files. It turned out the idea clicked. We got angel funding from this guy named Mark Cuban. This was before Shark Tank but it was very similar. So we got this funding and thought this was going to be super exciting.
我們就有了這個創意並創立了box公司
我們當時注意到在軟件行業
有很多因素已經變了
第一個因素是存儲成本
顯著下降
幾乎每年
公司存入硬盤的數據量
可以翻番
兩三年前挺奢侈的東西
現在用得起了
因為計算成本和存儲成本下降了
有了更加強大的瀏覽器和網絡
Firefox嶄露頭角
無論是在家裡還是在學校裡
上網速度更快了
人們將資料存在更多的地方
並且想在彼此之間進行分享
我們抓住了
突然出現的這三個要素
後面我會講到一些實戰建議
到時還會提到這幾個因素
首先提醒大家一點
要不斷尋找不斷變化的科技要素
如果市場有潛在的大變化
無論是原材料還是促成要素
就預示著該市場要有大變化
我們很幸運地意識到
雲端的數據需求在大大增長
而且存儲成本在快速下降
存儲可行性在增強
所以我們迅速創辦了Box公司
發布了box.net
產品理念就是文件輕鬆分享
事實證明我們的產品很有市場
我們從Mark Cuban那獲得天使投資
這在Shark Tank之前不過類似
我們獲得投資後非常興奮
We are going to drop out of college, we are going to move to the Bay area, and it's going to be awesome. And when you drop out of college, anybody drop out of college yet? Okay, good. Stay in school! When you drop out of college, everyone pictures it like it's going to be incredible. Bill Gates dropped out of college, it will be like Bill Gates. Or Michael Dell dropped out of college, it will be super exciting like Michael Dell. Steve Jobs dropped out of college, so this is what people imagine, but nobody ever remembers that this guy dropped out of college also.
我們決定要輟學
要搬到​​灣區想像著前途一片光明
你們中有人輟學了嗎？
好的別輟學
大家可能覺得
輟學是件挺酷的事
就像Bill Gates那樣
成就一番事業
或者像Michael Dell那樣
像Michael Dell那樣非常酷
或者像Steve Jobs那樣
這只是大家的一廂情願而已
大家不會記起來圖中這個人也曾輟學
So it's not really a guarantee that it's going to be successful. It's funny, I don't even know if this guy dropped out of college. It just seems like he had to. And I apologize if anyone is related to him, it's just a funny picture on the internet. So basically we decided we would drop out of college, we moved up to first Berkeley, then Palo Alto. We decided we were going to open up the product for free. We got hundreds of thousands of people to sign up for the product every single month. If you go to Box.net you get one free gigabyte of file storage space. Which once again was big back in 2006. But we were getting so many users, we were trying to figure out what to do.
輟學並不能保證
事業能夠成功
其實吧
我並不知道這個人是否輟學過
是我為了對比而設定的
如果此人與大家有關我表示歉意
只是我從網上下的圖
我們當時決定要輟學
先搬到了伯克利
後來搬到了帕羅奧多
我們打算產品免費試用
每個月會有數十萬的用戶
註冊試用我們的產品
如果登錄我們公司的網站
會找到一個免費版本的產品
可以免費獲得1G​​的存儲空間
當時應該是2006年
有了這麼多的用戶
我們尋求公司今後的出路
What we ran into was a common problem that, really, any startup runs into. Really pronounced by our business model which was, for consumers we built a very robust, very reliable enterprise. We really brought a really insignificant product. So for consumers, what we were running into was we had all these features you could pay for but a lot of consumers didn't need all those features. And for enterprises, we really didn't have enough securities and we didn't have enough capabilities around how enterprises want to use their data. So we had more than what a consumer needed and not enough that an enterprise needed. So we found ourselves at the juncture. We found ourselves basically in this period where its very difficult to figure out what we wanted to do with the business. So we had to make this choice. We were at this path, where we had to choose which path to go down.
我們遇到了一個
任何創業公司都會遇到的問題
從我們公司的經營模式上就能看出來
對於普通用戶
我們為其提供了穩健完善的產品
對於企業來講
我們做得遠遠不夠
對於普通用戶來講
我們打造的產品特徵值得購買
但是很多用戶並不需要所有這些特徵
對於企業來講
我們在安全性和容量方面做得還不夠
還沒有掌握企業在數據方面的需求
在產品功能上我們在顧客這方面做得過多
在企業方面做得還不夠
我們當時處於交叉路口
當時的處境下
很難抉擇
我們公司何去何從
我們面臨抉擇
在交叉路口上
我們得選擇走哪條路
This is back in early, mid 2006 up to late 2006. I was 23 at the time, my cofounder was 22. Our founding team was even younger, we had all dropped out of college. So in 2006, 2007, we imagined these two paths and the worlds were very very different. When you do a consumer startup it's basically lots of fun. You have parties all the time, it's just super exciting. Then in the enterprise you are battling these large, it's a rather thankless model because people just generally hate enterprise software. So that was sort of how we imagined the two paths, was we had to choose one of these two worlds. So we looked at that and thought. Okay consumer looks really fun, enterprise looks really hard and there is a lot of competition. At the same time, in this consumer space you are always fighting this issue of how do you monetize? How do you actually get people to pay for product? In the consumer space there are really only two business models that you can do.
當時是2006年中旬到下旬
我當時23歲
我的合夥人22歲創始團隊更年輕
我們剛從大學輟學而已
在2006 2007年
我們面臨截然不同的兩條路
如果決定面向普通用戶會有很多樂趣
有各種狂歡
非常興奮
如果是面向企業的話
有著重重障礙
會費力不討好
因為人們通常討厭企業軟件
所以我們有兩條路可以選擇
截然不同的兩條路
我們就想啊
選擇普通用戶比較有意思企業的話則很難
會有很多競爭
同時在普通用戶行列
通常要面臨的問題是
如何讓用戶付費買產品？
在普通用戶領域
有兩種經營模式可選
You can either have people pay for your application or you could provide advertising on the application. To give you a little bit of perspective, these are today's numbers. In the consumer world there are about thirty-five billion spent on mobile apps every year. Pretty big number right? Thirty-five billion dollars. That's a lot of money being spent on mobile apps today. For advertising, the global digital advertising is $135 billion dollars. So most consumer businesses are going after, if you are not doing e-commerce, are going after about $170 billion dollars of either purchasing power on applications or global advertising around these types of services. So big number, a lot of opportunity there.
要麼讓用戶付費使用產品
要麼在產品中打廣告
讓大家有更深的體會
這是目前的統計數字
讓大家體會一下兩模式的對比
在普通用戶領域
每年有350億美元花在移動應用軟件上
挺驚人的數字
350億\N258\N00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,​​840\N有這麼多錢花在移動應用軟件上\N259\N00:12:26,​​840 --> 00:12:33,600\N全球數字廣告市場收入是1350億美元
你懂的
除了電商公司
幾乎擁有眾多用戶的公司
會爭奪這1700億的市場
包括應用軟件和廣告
市場很大機會很多

However, in the enterprise there are $3.7 trillion on enterprise IT every single year. These are the servers, the infrastructure, the software, the networking, the services. All of that stack of technology equates to a few trillion spent every year. What we realized was there was a rather wide delta between these two markets. We are going to be fighting to get consumers to pay a few dollars a month. And Google, Microsoft, and Apple will try to make this product free over time. And there were rumors that google drive was coming out. And all these products that were going to happen, are coming out. But in enterprise, its not about them trying to save money on IT.They are either trying to increase productivity, they are trying to increase business. So the value equation is very different. So the consumer, we have limited amount of money that we wish to conserve for as few things as possible that we are going to spend. On the enterprise it's a little bit of a shift, actually what can I get out of technology? How much value is that for me? So that was a really important data point.
然而在企業這一塊
每年有3.7萬億美元花在了IT上
包括服務器基礎設施
軟件網絡服務等等
每年有上萬億美元
花在了這些方面
我們意識到
這兩個市場有很大的不同
在普通用戶領域我們得為了
讓顧客每個月付幾美元而奮鬥
同時Google Microsoft和Apple公司會
逐漸地讓產品免費化
有傳言說Google硬盤即將推出
類似我們公司產品的產品
即將推出
企業在IT上不會小氣
他們的目標是提高生產率
是有更好的業績
普通用戶和企業在價值衡量方面是不同的
普通用戶的話
資金有限
得確保花出去的錢能得到最大回報
企業方面則不同
他們考慮的是
如何通過科技來創造更大的價值
這點很重要
However, the problem was that enterprise software was very unsexy right? Very competitive, very hard to build a business. It wasn't something you shot out of bed in the morning saying, I'm super excited to build an enterprise software company. And the reason for that was actually very straight forward at the time. The way that you built software was very slow. It was very slow because you couldn't break anything for customers, the sales process was very slow because customers take a long time to purchase technology. So I think everyone is used to this philosophy that when you are trying to sell enterprise software, it could take up to years for them to actually just buy the software. Then it could take even more years for them to implement the technology in the first place. So a lot of companies are around for years without their technology even used in the first place.
然後企業軟件
吸引力不大
競爭壓力大創業困難
投身其中的話不會有這樣的感受：
早上起來
因為打造企業軟件而異常興奮
個中原因
其實很簡單
打造企業軟件的過程很漫長
因為顧客是企業不能有閃失
所以得穩重而且靈活度底
銷售過程也很漫長
因為企業在購買IT產品方面深思熟慮
大家可能有這樣的體會
通常賣給企業軟件
需要幾年的時間
僅僅是賣給他們而已
等到他們大規模地使用
又得過幾年的時間
很多公司得等好幾年

That felt like a huge problem, and not something that we wanted to be a part of. The technology itself is complex, I don't know how many people have had to use enterprise software but it's generally really complicated. You try to figure out, why in God’s creation did a designer try to put forty-seven buttons on one page. You just can't even understand it and the reason is something we will get into in a second. But basically there is just no love or care for the design or user service. The software is just complex. And finally, if that wasn't bad enough, you have to figure out how you are going to sell this software. For anyone who loves the power of the internet, this notion of having a sales intermediary to get to your customer, seemed really unappealing. You have to hire a bunch of people, who are going to be in every country, they are going to be the only interface you have to your customer. You hire this guy named Chuck, and Chuck is going to roll in with a brief case and he is going to try to sell lots of enterprise software to the customer. Just so we are clear, this is what Chuck looks like. And that was the sale process that you, in the enterprise at least, that we imagined in our head. Chuck looks like a happy guy, but he is still an intermediary to getting your software. Well why cant use the power of to internet and get our technology out here that way?
他們的IT產品才應用到企業中
這個問題很嚴重
是我們極力想避免的 產品本身很複雜 至於體驗呢  不知道有多少人由於工作需要不得不使用企業軟件  產品本身真的很複雜 他們可能在心裡咒罵
為什麼設計者在一個頁面上弄了47個按鍵！真是讓人費解
我們過一會就會講到為什麼會這樣
總之人們不喜歡
企業軟件的設計和體驗
軟件很複雜
如果我上面講到的這麼問題
對你來說還不是太頭疼
那麼還有如何把軟件賣出去的問題
對於喜歡互聯網營銷的人來說
通過中間人才能接觸到顧客
讓人很不爽
得僱很多人
分派到國家的各個地方
他們是你與顧客交流的媒介
比如說僱一個叫Chuck的業務員
他挎著公文包
極力向顧客
推銷企業軟件
就像這幅圖中這個人一樣
這就是企業軟件的銷售過程
至少大家印像中是這樣的
Chuck貌似挺開心的
得通過他才能實現對接
所以我們就這麼想：
為什麼我們不利用網絡的力量
將產品直接面向顧客呢？

Why should we have to go through this sales intermediary as we scale up the business? I will get into it in a minute why we were wrong about the sales business. But this was sort of the fear that we had. And if that wasn't hard enough, we had investors saying, in 2007, basically there is no way you are going to make it in enterprise. You again, are basically a founding team of 20 year olds. You don't have anyone on your team that has been in an enterprise. Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, these companies are going to stomp on you. This is going to be very very hard to succeed. And to be fair they were right on several areas. We were a very inexperienced team. We were still very early in our careers. Our co-founder, for instance, looked like he was 13 years old. Just to be clear on what he looked like. So it sort of made sense right? This is him as our CFO, I think this is him at 29. But it looked like we were going to run off with the money and go to Disneyland. I appreciate why they didn't think we could pull it off. I can't imagine giving him money.
我們發展業務為什麼非得
通過銷售中間人呢？
我過會會講到
為什麼我們剛才對銷售過程的想法是錯的呢
這是我們當時面臨的恐懼
如果還不夠困難的話
在2007年有投資人說
在企業軟件上你們不可能成功
你們的創始團隊只是一群20來歲的孩子
你們創始人團隊裡沒人在企業里呆過
微軟EMC
Oracle和IBM
這些土豪公司會對你們圍追堵截
成功是很難的
這些投資人說的有些地方是挺對的
我們的團隊沒什麼經驗
我們尚在事業初期
我的合夥人看起來就像個13歲的小孩子
圖中就是我的合夥人
他們那麼想情有可原
這是我的合夥人兼CFO29歲時的照片
大家可能會覺得我們會拿著投資人的錢
去迪士尼樂園玩去了
我完全理解
為什麼他們不相信我們會成功
把錢投給這樣的小鮮肉我也無法接受
So, we decided that we still have to go do it. We have to give this our best shot. We are going to take the scale, the consumer experience, the DNA of our company and we are going to see if we can bring this into the enterprise. We were really fortunate. We had an investor, early in his career, make a belief on us because there was something changing with the enterprise that we would be able to take advantage of. We decided, if we are going to do the enterprise, if we were going to go after the enterprise, we were going to have to play with a very different set of rules. So what about the complexity of software can change in this era? What about the sales process is very slow can change in this new era? How do we move and go directly to the user the customer, instead of having this really indirect process at getting our technology out there? How do we build a design for the user instead of just for the RFP process that a customer is going to go through? So we looked at all of the factors that are true with the enterprise and we are going to do, not in all cases, the opposite. We are going to find what has changed in the technology world that we can build a newer, and better software company. That was the decision we embarked on, the path we embarked on 8 years ago. And that is why we have been focused on enterprise.
我們決定至少得試一下
全力以赴地試一下
我們決定把
我們公司的文化——消費者體驗
試著帶到企業中
我們非常幸運
找到一位尚在事業初期的投資人
他把寶壓在了我們身上
因為他相信
我們可以利用
企業中發生的巨大變化
我們就想
如果我們投身企業​​軟件行列
我們得游刃於不同的遊戲規則中
在企業軟件複雜度方面可以有什麼改變呢？
關於銷售過程緩慢
我們可以對此做出什麼改變呢？
我們採取什麼樣的策略來接觸到顧客呢？
而不是遵循常規地
間接式銷售策略呢
如何面向使用者來設計產品
而不是僅僅按照需求方案說明書
死板地來設計呢？
我們尋找企業軟件中
可以改變的因素
當然我們不可能100%做到
不過我們要發現IT行業的變化
並且利用這種變化
來打造一個更好的更先進的企業軟件公司
這就是我們當時做出的抉擇
8年前我們選擇的道路
這就是為什麼我們專注於企業軟件
Today, again we have about two hundred and forty thousand businesses using the product. And the reason is we architected the business model, we architected the software, we architected the solution to work in one specific version of the world, and it turned out that one solution was the one that happened. And I will go a little bit into what has changed in the world that we sort of built our company around. And what I would highly recommend to you, if you are building an enterprise software company to orient to your technology. So that was sort of why we made the decision, how we started to take on the problem.
時至今日
有24萬家企業使用我們的產品
我們的成功在於我們重構了銷售模型
重構了軟件
重構了解決方案
我們面向一種特定的形式世界
並且事實證明
我們的判斷是對的
稍候我會介紹
我們是基於什麼樣的世界變化來打造我們公司的
所以我強烈地建議大家
如果你要創建企業軟件公司的話
要確保自己的IT產品順應世界潮流
前面我介紹了我們為什麼以及怎樣
做出了那樣的選擇
現在我要講一下
企業軟件行業發生的哪些變化
使得進入這個行業變得可能
或者說比以前更容易

So everything about enterprise, and by definition the software that the enterprise uses, has changed just in the past 5 years. If there ever was a magical time to build an enterprise software company, now is that time in terms of how much has changed in what is going on with organizations. Lets go over a couple of these things. The first is that most application companies are moving to the cloud. And the biggest thing is, if you are going to start a business management company, or a business intelligence company, even a contact management company years ago you had to have you idea implemented in every single customer location. No matter how many customers you sold to, no matter what region you were in, every customer had to put that in their datacenter. That was the flaw with on premise computing. You were doing all this work, you were creating so much redundancy, it was the slowing down the whole process of delivering and building software for the enterprise. All of a sudden the cloud came around, things like Sales Source. com, things like Amazon Web Services, basically said. Why is it that every customer that wants to implement a couple servers, have to implement servers, put them in their data server, but security or networking around them, six months later they go live and a developer can use them in the organization, same thing with an application? They said, why does that make any sense today? We could just put together tens of thousands of servers, put them on demand, and you can use whatever you want, when you want and we can do that. That obviously is the definition of Cloud Computing. What's happening is CIO’s and large enterprises are taking advantage of this. So it seems obvious to everyone in this room because you would never build your company by buying your own servers. You would start is on google, yahoo, or ashore rather. But to an enterprise there are decades of infrastructure that now has to move to that cloud. So thats a massive shift that is actually happening.
在過去的5年裡
企業以及企業軟件
發生了翻天覆地的變化
如果說
創辦企業軟件公司
有什麼最佳時機的話
就是現在
這是從該行業的變化角度來說的
我們來看一下都有哪些變化
首先大部分的應用
轉到了雲端
顯著的變化就是
10或15年前
如果你想創辦個客戶關係管理軟件公司
或者是商業智能軟件公司
或者是內容管理公司
基本上你得到每個顧客所在地
為其提供技術支持
無論你賣給了多少顧客
無論他們公司在哪裡
都得為每個顧客的數據中心進行安裝
就地部署計算的缺點在於
重複勞動
造成了非常多的冗餘
這就
延緩了為企業
打造軟件的進程
突然間雲端出現了
有了Salesforce
有了Amazon Web Service
這樣的話
為什麼還要為每個顧客設置服務器呢
在服務器上處理數據的話
得在數據中心安置服務器
還要配備安全和網絡等輔助設施
到企業設備正式使用
得花6個月的時間
應用也是如此
Amazon認為我們剛才所說的東西已經落伍了
可以把數百
數万數十萬的服務器聯合起來
讓它們隨時待命
這樣就可以隨時處理要處理的東西了
這其實就是雲計算的概念
這一優勢
已經為很多大型企業的首席信息官所用
很容易理解
因為創辦公司不用買自己的服務器了
使用Amazon Google和Azure給提供的就行
對於企業而言
它們在基礎設施上已經投資了數十年

We are moving to a world of cheaper, on demand computing from a world of expensive computing. The benefit of starting a startup is the customers don't have the same friction,, they are going to go and adopt new technology. As soon as the computing becomes cheaper, its easier to adopt new solutions. Which means, their barrier for showing you in--the barrier is a lot lower which is great for startups. We are going from a world of customized platforms to standardize softwares. It use to be that you had to build all the customizations, all the customer experiences on top of the software itself and now customers are realizing that they won't open platforms and they can customize a layer on top of the product. It use to be that when you started an enterprise software, you could only sell to the top five or ten thousand companies in the world. Because only those companies had the wear with all, the talent, the infostructure, and the budget to employ you technology into the enterprise .Today, literally a two person company can sign up for box, as well as we work with General Electric who has over 300 thousand employees. So the fact that you can now serve a small business anywhere in the world, as well as some of the largest on the planet means there are much larger markets you can go after. Which makes it an even better economical proposition to go after the enterprise. The platforms themselves are becoming more global. Our customers were internationally a couple weeks after starting the company. If you would have done enterprise the traditional way that would have take years to actually be able to go internally.
現在轉移到雲端的話
顯然轉移的任務量很大
計算成本從昂貴
變得便宜低成本
目前創業的一個優勢是
顧客採納新技術的阻力減小了  採用你們的產品的阻力減小了  計算成本的降低
使得採納新技術變得容易
這就是說更新換代的障礙
採納你們產品的障礙
大大減小了
這就為創業營造了巨大的發展機遇
目前從定制軟件
轉變到了標準平台上
過去得以軟件為基礎
打造產品功能和用戶體驗
現在顧客意識到
他們想要的其實是開放的平台
可以在產品層面上進行定制
過去的企業軟件
只能賣給
前5%的公司或是說1萬家企業
因為只有這些企業
才有相應的技術人員基礎設施和財力
購買企業軟件
今天只有兩個人的公司
可以像有30萬員工的通用電氣一樣
註冊使用我們的產品
也就是說你可以為大公司提供服務
同樣可以
為小公司提供服務
這就意味著有了更廣闊的市場
顯然
在企業軟件方面有更多的商機
平臺本身變得全球化
我們的顧客
在創業的幾週內
就國際化了
如果按照傳統的方式打造企業軟件的話
得花數年的時間
才能國際化
And finally, the most profound shift of all, mobile devices. iPhones, iPads, Androids, Tablets, IT of these models have become a lot more user led. It's fundamentally important. In an IT world, incumbents generally win because they have the existing relationship with the IT organization, with the CIO, with the spending power of that company. In a user lead model, users are bringing in their own technology. They’re bring it in in the sales team, they are bringing it in in the marketing team, they are brining it in in finance and you can build software around that user. Which means they can bring the enterprise in and you can sell to the enterprise when they want to have better control, better security, better scalability.
最深遠的變化是
由於移動設備
iPhone iPad 安卓平板等
企業的IT模型變得更加以消費者為導向
本質上這點非常重要
在IT導向的世界中先下手者佔上風
因為他們已經和IT機構
與CIO和公司的消費主力建立了聯繫
在用戶導向的模型中用戶引入技術
引入到銷售團隊中
引入到營銷團隊中
引入到財務中
可以基於用戶打造產品
也就是說是用戶把IT產品引入到公司
當他們公司需要更好的控制性更好的安全性
更好的可擴展性時
就可以順勢把產品賣給他們公司

So you still have the same model as a business software company but the way to get into the company now is through the end user. So those are quantitative factory changes. Just a couple quantitative changes, there is over nearly 2 billion smart phones on the planet. That changes every single IT model planet. Because it use to be 10 years ago, if you were managing technology for the company, you just had to manage the computers network that was inside your building. But now with billions of smart phones you have to manage ways of computing anywhere at any time on any network. And that becomes big in software companies, because no incumbent has built a technology stack that powers this line of work and how enterprises are using their data. So that creates a massive start up opportunity.
和傳統的企業軟件公司相比
商業模型是一樣的
不過產品是通過終端使用者引入到他們公司的
以上是質變
其他的質變還有
目前全球有近20億智能手機
這個龐大的數量改變了每個IT模型
十年前
為企業提供技術支持的話
只需要弄好電腦和
內部網絡就行了
現在有了數十億手機
就得維護好網絡
和數據處理
從而用戶可以隨時隨地登錄
這就為軟件公司帶來了很大的機會
There are nearly 3 billion people online. That means that every single enterprise is changing how they are going to give their own products to their customers. Which means that every industry changes. There are only two times, two moments of opportunity where a technology revolution will happen in an enterprise. The first is where raw materials change. So cost of computing goes down and they centralize and let people use it on demand. The second thing that can change, is the very people that these enterprises have to go after need new experiences at that enterprises product. Let me give you an example. If you go off campus you probably use something like Uber or Lyft. If you are in the shipping business, if you are in the transportation business, Uber represents a massive change to your industry. So you can't let Uber exist without understanding, what are the implications of Uber? What are the implications of Instacart? What are the implications of Lyft to my business model?
目前有30億網民
這就意味著每個企業同樣在改變
改變他們向用戶提供產品的方式
每個企業都要改變
有兩個時間點
有兩種時機
使得企業爆發技術革命
第一是原材料在變
計算成本在下降這樣更利於集中處理數據
使得人們可以隨心地使用
第二個主要變化是
企業面向的客戶群
對於企業提供的產品有新的體驗需求
舉例來說
如果你走出校園
你很可能會使用Uber或是Lyft
如果你從事運輸行業
從事船運或是物流行業
Uber對你從事的行業有很大的影響
你不能對Uber不聞不問
不去反思
Uber會帶來什麼影響？
InstaCart會帶來什麼影響？
Lyft對於我們公司有什麼影響？
So in a world where enterprises are dealing with that kind of change, you are going to need new technology to help them create their business models, how they adapt to this disruption. This is why it's such an amazing time to even start vertical software companies for industries. Right now every single industry is going through a business model and technology orientated disruption. Means they are going to need technology from start ups to help them work through this. I will give you a couple of examples: so in the retail industry there's this vision of omni channel or multichannel commerce. You are going to shop online, you are going to shop on your phone, you are going to shop in a store, and you want things to be delivered to you as well. So most of the incumbent technology does not power multichannel commerce. No one is prepared, what does it mean when consumers want to go buy goods anytime from anywhere with better information, better intelligence. So every retailer in the world is going to need a new technology stack to power their retail experiences.
全世界的企業
都在應對這種變化
他們需要新的技術
協助他們更新換代他們的商業模型
適應這種變革
此時是
打造面向各行各業的
垂直型軟件公司的契機
目前各行各業都在經歷
重大的商業模型和技術的變革
這就意味著他們需要創業公司的技術
來幫助他們過渡
舉個零售業的例子
目前有全渠道或是多渠道銷售的概念
消費者會在網上購物在手機上購物
在實體店購物
希望可以送貨上門
在零售業大部分先行者的技術
還滿足不了多渠道銷售
還沒有公司
擁有完善的信息和智​​能技術
使得消費者無後顧之憂地隨時隨地購物
每個零售商
都需要新技術
為顧客提供新的購物體驗

In the healthcare space, every single health care institution is trying to find ways of building more personalized experiences, more predictive experiences, they want to have medicine be adapted to the individual. As the business model of healthcare changes to being about the surgery, charging for the check up, and instead, really where the customer pays for the wellness and staying healthy. Then all of a sudden every healthcare institution needs technology to deliver health care experiences. They are going to want to deliver telemedicine. They are going to want to deliver health care in more regional locations instead of just in the monolithic hospital environment. There are going to be new use cases coming around. How are our healthcare providers get connected to one another so one doctor can make better decisions? All of these things are going to require new enterprise software to power these businesses and industries.
在醫護領域每個醫護機構
都在極力尋找方法來提供更個性化的服務
更前瞻性的服務
他們希望醫療可以私人化
使得醫護商業模型發生變化
從醫院收取手術
收取檢查費
變成消費者為健康付費
所有的醫護機構
都需要新技術來提供新的醫護體驗
從而可以提供遠距離醫療
突破醫院地理位置的限制
向更多的地區提供服務
會有新的病歷出現
如何使得電子病歷融合
從而使醫生可以做出更好的病情判斷
以上所說的種種
都需要新技術的支持

In the media space, as an example, you have a world where the industry is going from really linear programming, whether that's television or that's music or that's movies, it's a linear supply chain oriented business model, when a film gets made, it goes to the theater for 3 months, then afterwards it goes to iTunes or other platforms, to a world where people want experiences on demand. So that's going to change how distribution works on a scale of 3 billion people on the internet, and again no media network has a platform that is actually going to power how content, data, and information moves to this system at scale. I was just in LA yesterday, meeting with a media company that has basically done predictive analytics to find their potential moviegoers in the middle of 3 billion users. They want to be hyper targeted on how to get to the specific 3 billion fans that are into a certain film types. And so all of a sudden you have a movie company who needs big data and they need business intelligence and marketing in order to go and market and distribute.
比如說媒體行業
目前的媒體行業
經歷著從線性規劃變成…
無論是電視音樂
還是電影
都是基於線性供應鏈的商業模型
電影製作完成後
先在影院上映三個月
然後放到iTunes或是其他平台上
人們可以按需觀看
這樣就會改變
30億網民觀看電影的
分佈情況
目前還沒有媒體公司擁有這樣的平台
使得內容數據和信息
可以大規模地
融合到系統中
昨天
我在LA和一家媒體公司會面
他們公司做的是預測性分析
在30億網名中找到
有潛力的電影觀看者
他們想要精確定位
特定3000萬人
是哪些類型電影的粉絲
突然間就有這樣的電影公司
需要大數據
需要商業智能需要營銷自動化
來協助他們制定營銷策略

This is where two industries come together, where all new software is going to be necessary. So every industry is going through some form of this change. You can take any industry you want and zoom into it and say, what are the underlying technology factors that are going to change the business model for the next couple of years? And then there is going to need to be software to power those types of experiences. Think of the future of water, who is going to power that? That's going to need software, I'm sure.
重申一下
兩種行業突然就這樣融合起來了
需要很多新技術作為支撐
每個行業都在經歷類似這樣的變化
你可以隨便選一個行業
然後放大來看
在今後幾年裡
什麼樣的潛在科技因素會改變
該行業的商業模型呢
相應地就需要軟件來
支持相應的用戶體驗
能跟得上我吧？
So basically every company in the world, the great thing about being at Stanford is we study the technology. And we think of the technology industry as an industry. But in reality what is happening, is every industry is going to have a technology component of what they do. Enterprises are not going to be able to survive in the future if they do not get good at technology. If they don't have competency at leveraging data and using these new tools. But they are going to do that by working with what we call the technology industry.

每個公司…
呆在帕羅奧多在斯坦福
一個好處是我們可以高度專注於科技
科技行業也是一種行業
現實是科技對於每個公司每個行業而言
是必須的一部分
一個企業如果不能
善於利用科技
不能利用數據
和使用新的技術工具
在未來就無法生存
如果與技術公司合作
他們就能做到這些
而不是
關起門來自己開發技術
Instead of everyone else building out in these expertise for themselves. So there's going to be a lot of partnership over the next five to ten years where companies are going to need technology to work smarter, to work faster, they are going to need to do this more securely. And this is not only going to change how individuals work in these environments but ultimately change the business models of these companies. So that was chapter two of this.
今後的五到十年間
會有更多的企業和科技公司合作
從而使自己的企業
發展更快更智能
更安全
從而不僅可以改變員工的工作環境
也可以改變這些公司的商業模型
以上是第二大部分的內容
講的是一些變化
Now I'll give you some practical advice to help you get started. To be fair, most of this advice is looking through the lens of retrospect which means this is not how this is going to happen, but I can look back through time and say that these are the things that led this to be true. It's hard to be deterministic about building a company. You may not have all these things figured out, but this will give you a sense of pattern to recognize as you are building or thinking about building an enterprise software company.
現在我們講一些關於創業的實用建議
大部分建議
都是事後之明
也就是說我們當時並不知道這樣是對的
而是回顧總結的時候發現
從結果來看這些方法是對的
在創立公司的時候很難做到胸有成竹
所以這些建議你不一定都能用得上\N703\N00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,​​960\N這些建議可以給你大體的框架\N704\N00:32:26,​​960 --> 00:32:29,510\N讓你在創建或打算創建公司的時候
給你一些借鑒的模式或幫助你發現機遇
So the first one is spot technology disruptions. This is going to be true whether you are building consumer or enterprise. The rest are more enterprise, but this is just fundamental if you are going to build a tech company. You have to look for new enabling technologies, or major trends, like fundamental trends, that create a wide gap between how things are done and how they can be done. Looking back in time to our business, the gap was basically storage was getting cheaper, internet was getting faster, browsers where getting better yet we are still sharing files with this very complicated, very cumbersome means. Anytime, between the delta of what is possible, and how things work today is at its widest. That is an opportunity to build new technology to go solve a problem. As you are looking at the enterprise, the question is, what about the cost of computing dropping so rapidly changes what enterprises can do with their data?
第一點是洞悉科技變革
這一點既適用於面向普通用戶的公司
又適用於面向企業的公司
後面幾點偏向於面向企業的公司
如果要創建科技公司的話
這點是非常重要的企業家精神
你要尋找新的技術或主流趨勢
比如根本性的趨勢
發現“目前的做法”和“應該怎麼改進”
之間的差距
回顧我們公司的發展
這個差距就是存儲成本變低了
互聯網變快了瀏覽器變好了
然而文件分享還是得通過
複雜的難搞的龜速的笨重的方式來實現
當“目前的做法”和“理想的做法”
之間的差距最大時
此時是創業來解決這個問題的
最佳時機
放眼企業領域
想一想計算成本的快速降低
會給企業處理數據帶來什麼樣的影響呢？
從商業模型角度來看
這會帶來什麼變化呢？
What does it do to change from a business standpoint? What was impossible, because of either economic feasibility or technical feasibility that 10-15 years ago is now possible. A fun thing to do every now and then, if you find a newspaper article from the 1990’s or 1980’s, business articles about technology, all we are really doing is repeating all the technologies we tried 10, 20, 30 years ago. It was too expensive, too unusable, and we didn't have the enabling technologies to make it possible. You can see this concept emerge, something that was impossible 5, 10 years ago is now very practical. I will give you an example. There is a company called PlanGrid, does anyone know what PlanGrid does? Okay, cool. Are you in the construction industry? You are? Oh my god! What does that even mean?
由於經濟和技術的限制
什麼東西在10年或15年前是不可能的
而現在
突然變得可能了呢？
有興趣的話你可以
翻看一些上世紀八九十年代的
科技方面的商業文章
我們現在使用的技術其實是
10年20年或30年前發明的技術
當時由於價格昂貴
這些技術無法大規模使用
你可以發現其中的規律
5年或10年前無法實施的技術
現在突然大規模使用了
Q: PlanGrid? Or construction?
舉例來說PlanGrid公司
有人知道這個公司嗎？
你是建築行業的嗎？
Aaron Levie: Construction.

Q: I work at a job site, we build buildings.
建築業\N751\N00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38​​,470\N我們是搞建築的\N752\N00:34:38​​,470 --> 00:34:40,100\N挺好的

Aaron Levie: Holy crap, that's great. Basically PlanGrid is a mobile application that lets you manage construction projects, lets you access your blueprints, lets you manage all the data around a construction process. And what this company realized is, 4 billion dollars, I think, are spent every year printing out blueprints. And they have all the prints and updates to them anytime there a change, then they have to ripple and cascade through a very wide network of contractors and construction workers every time. Even if it's one slight, minute change, suddenly they realized, with the iPad, we have the perfect form factor to load up blueprints and content. This is something that can ripple through the construction industry, which isn't really known for high technology, except on the design side. How can they build technology that makes data collaboration problem really seamless and easy to do in an industry that hasn't really changed in a while? It was a perfect discovery of a change in a market and figuring out how those two things converge. Then this team built a great startup for it that is doing incredibly well and taking over the construction industry as proven by this individual. Thank you.
PlanGrid是一款移動應用
可以用來管理建築項目
可以查看規劃圖
可以管理建築中的各種數據
該公司團隊注意到
每年有40億美元花在了
打印規劃圖
以及更新每次改動後的規劃圖上
即使規劃圖
有很小的變動
都得興師動眾
規劃圖重新發給承包商建築人員
他們意識到
有了iPad
規劃圖以及其他數據可以傳到iPad上
就可以以電子的形式
下發到建築人員手中
以前只有設計才用到的高大上技術
現在可以廣泛使用了
如何利用科技的力量
使得好久沒有改變的傳統行業
能夠輕鬆地做到
數據獲取和融合呢
這是個很好的例子
他們發現了市場的變化\N779\N00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55​​,780\N並且利用科技提供了解決方案\N780\N00:35:55​​,780 --> 00:35:57,880\N該團隊基於此
創建了一個成功的公司
在建築行業
獨領風騷
The next thing is, in enterprise, you want to start intentionally small. What I mean by that is you want to find, this is more true with all companies in an enterprise in a user light paradigm, you want to find the wedge that is sort of natural that you can create a product that will slip in the gaps of other existing products. But something that you think over time expands to be a more important product of the enterprise structure. What you want to start to do is say, we will take this sliver of a problem, we are going to make the user experience on the incredible. We are either going to change the business model, we are going to create new technology to make this previously problem really really simple. It might feel small at first, maybe you are going after small businesses and then you are going to go up market. Maybe you are starting with a sliver of the use case and expand out, but you intentionally start small. Because you will not be able to compete with an incumbent because the incumbent is always going to go for the full solution. So you have to find, what are the gaps in the full solution, that are significant enough that the customer is going to want to solve the problem with a discreet technology. But over time you are going to be able to expand. Again to either larger customers or to more use cases over time.
另一件要注意的事情是
在開始的時候要刻意保持較小規模的公司
很多公司都是這樣子
尤其是企業軟件的領域
這是一個以用戶為導向的模式
你必須找到一個很好的切入點
能讓你做出來的產品
很好地填補現有產品的空白
但隨著時間的推移
也可以成為一個成熟的企業模式
所以在初期你要做的就是
發現問題
在那些難以處理的問題上提高用戶體驗
一種方法是改變商業模式
另外一種則是
創造新的技術讓困難的問題變得很簡單
可能開始時公司很小
進入的是一個小市場
但逐漸就會佔有更大的市場份額
也許你可以從一個具體的用例開始
然後進行擴展
但開始時必須要讓公司保持小規模
因為你還不能與現有的公司競爭
因為他們通常都擁有完整的解決方案
因為你必鬚髮現現有的解決方案有哪些問題
並且這些問題
也足夠會引起用戶的重視
會讓用戶希望去解決它們
然後你就可以逐漸進行擴展
要麼吸引更大的客戶要麼創造更多的用例

Great example is ZenPayroll. ZenPayroll was started by Stanford graduates couple of years ago. Basically, they discovered that the payroll is some small business is complicated and incredibly annoying process. That is because we use the same vendors that we have for decades to do that and they were digitally ordinated. You didn't get your payments as a receipt over email. Very complicated. You didn't get to see graphs of your salaries. There was really no good data around this. And they said we are going to take off the slice that is most painful to start out at, around hiring people and paying people. Just that payroll management process. We are going to plug into a lot of existing structure. But we are going to make it dead simple to go do this. And now they are able to move up market over time as well as deliver new services over time. And what happens is the incumbent in this market, eventually looks at something like Zen Payroll and says, well thats small. Its only for small businesses’. How can it be very powerful? But thats just the start. As they get that wedge, as they fit into the market, they are going to be able to expand again over time. Build out more services and more capabilities. But they found just the right, exact opening to build a new company and have the emerge.
Zenpayroll是個很好的例子  Zenpayroll是一群斯坦福的研究生創立的
就在幾年前
他們發現在小公司管理工資單這件事情
是一個很複雜​​也很煩人的過程
因為大家用的都是相同的供應商的軟件
已經用了幾十年了
所以軟件還沒有數字化
你不能通過電子郵件獲得工資單
非常煩人
你也不能看到每個月薪資的趨勢圖表
也沒有十分有用的數據
這幾個創業者決定從這裡入手
因為對於創業公司來說
招聘發薪雖然只是個簡單的管理過程
但沒有好用的軟件確實是很痛苦的一件事情
雖然他們使用的很多都是已有的技術
但卻把這個過程變得非常簡單
現在他們不僅佔領了很大的市場份額
也開始擴展新功能
但成熟的公司對於這個問題的看法通常是
他們看了關於薪資管理這個領域
會感覺市場太小了
只有小公司有這種需求難有大的作為
但這僅僅是開始
因為這是一個進入市場的很好的切入點
隨著時間推移肯定可以不斷進行擴展
加入更多服務和功能
可以說他們的創業
在開始階段的方向是很正確的

Then next you really want to find asymmetries. You want to do things that incumbents can't or won't do because either the economics don't make sense for them, the economics are so unusual, or because technically they can't. I will give you two examples. So, if you are going to build software today for the enterprise that goes after an incumbent category, that has more of a suite? oriented approach. Then what you are going to want to do is build technology that is platform agnostic. What suite players will do is want everything to be integrated with itself, and theres more value with the vertical integration. But you want to go after a different access. Which you want your technology to work across all the platforms. That way you can work with so many different kinds of customers. You can be an ally to so many kinds of platforms, which a traditional incumbent is not able to do. That is technically infeasible because its architecture or its a fundamental component business model to not do that. The other thing is, trying to do things that is economic feasible. You can look at the cost structure of an incumbent company and discover where they are not going to be able to drop their prices. Because that business model is fundamental to the company. Or where can you find ways of monetizing the customer that are unusual or unique that no one has discovered before, thus making impractical for anyone else to do.

下一點是要找到現有結構的不合理之處
你會發現-- 哎呀我去
咱們過後能把聲音調調嗎
至少讓人感覺我是在唱rap那樣子--
所以你要做的是
大公司不能做或者不想做的東西
原因要麼是因為他們對這裡的利潤不感興趣
要麼是模式與原來很不一樣
或者他們在技術上做不到
我講兩個例子
如果現在你想要做企業軟件
但在這個行當裡面
已經有更大的公司在做了
那麼你要做的是
創造出與平台無關的技術
因為前輩們想做的事情是
把所有內容都整合到自己的軟件裡面
這樣的垂直整合能帶來很多價值
但你要從另外一個角度入手
你要讓你的技術可以適應任何一種平台
這樣不同類型的客戶就都可以使用你的東西
這樣你就可以和各種平台建立合作關係
這是傳統企業做不到的
說這種方式對於傳統企業在技術上是不可行的
是因為他們的軟件已經整合設計好了
或者說他們商業模式的基本組成
與這一理念相衝突
另外一種情況是
做那些大公司在商業上做不到的事情
比如你可以看看大公司的成本結構
找出他們在哪個環節無法降低成本
因為這種商業模式
是這些公司無法捨棄的
或者你可以找出一些用戶的
獨特的需求
別人沒發現的需求
因此這也是其他人做不到而你可以做的東西
There is a company called Zenefits where they have an HR management software company that helps you as a small startup manage all your benefits, all your HR information. And instead of charging the startup that may not value the software stage they are at, they realize they can get commission from the insurance companies that pays for the ability to use their software. The customer itself is not paying for Zenefits. Zenefits platform is being paid for by the insurance company and they have thus created a business model that no other software company has been able to think of or attack. And they are equally going and disrupting a category that has not seen a lot of innovation previously which is the health and benefits space in small businesses.
有個公司叫Zenefits
他們做了一個人力資源管理的軟件
可以幫助小公司
管理所有的福利和人力資源信息
他們沒有對創業公司收費
也許這樣在他們目前處於的階段沒法獲得價值
但他們發現可以從保險公司那裡
獲得佣金
通過這樣的方式公司可以獲得軟件的使用權
所以客戶本身是不用給Zenefits錢的
Zenefits這個平台是從保險公司那裡賺錢
這種模式是他們原創的
其他軟件公司沒有考慮過也無法與之抗衡
因此Zenefits成功打亂了這個市場的格局
在此之前對於小公司的健康與福利這個領域
沒有多少創新可言

The next is you want to find the mostly crazy, but still reasonable outliers within the customer ecosystem. So you need to find the customers that are at the edge of the business, their business model, their industry and find the unique characteristics of those customers. Leverage them as your early adopters. Paul Graham has a great article where he talks about living in the future and building what is missing when you are living in the future. Thats an easy way to spot trends and patterns about disruption that is playing out. The same is true in the workplace. If you find customers that are working in the future, you will be able to work with them to find what is missing in the future. And how do we build technology that supports all these new use cases that are going to emerge? There is a company called Skycatch that does enterprise drones. At first it seems kind of weird, but in construction space, farming they are using drones now for data capture and modeling different environments. So this company is able to find all the companies that are on the bleeding edge of their industry. What is unique, or new about how those businesses operate. And they worked with a lot of those early adopters to establish their platform. Which really is first enterprise drone company. So the idea is, go look at your market. Find the customers on the bleeding edge of their market who use technology to get a head. And that use technology for performance advantages, and go work with them to see how your product can evolve.
下一步是要找出在客戶的生態系統中
比較瘋狂但又能說的通的一些
極端情況
你需要找出
處於這個邊緣的公司
商業模式或者領域
找出這些客戶獨有的特點
讓他們成為你的早期客戶
Paul Graham有一篇很好的文章
他講到要活在未來
並構建未來缺失的東西
這是一個發現問題的趨勢與規律
的一個簡單的方法
在企業中也是一樣的
如果你的客戶在做一些比較超前的東西
那麼和他們合作你就能找到
你以後要做的東西
以及如何創造在未來使這些東西
實現的技術
有個公司叫Skycatch 製造企業無人機
一開始可能大家會很奇怪
但在建築農業石油和天然氣等領域
他們使用無人機收集數據
用來對不同的環境進行建模
Skycatch找到了這些
處於其自身領域邊緣的公司
發現了這些公司運作的獨特與創新之處
這些公司很多都成為了他們的早期客戶
Skycatch幫助他們建立了平台
這也使他們成為了最早的企業無人機公司之一
因此這裡的想法是
找出那些處於市場邊緣的客戶們
這些用戶
通過使用技術不斷進步獲得優勢
然後與他們進行合作把你的產品整合到他們的企業中


Listen to your customers but don't always build exactly what they are telling you. This is a really key distinction around building enterprise software. Your customers are going to have a large number of requests. Your job is to instill those lists down into the ultimate product. This does not mean that you are not going to build exactly what they tell you to build. It is your job to listen to their problems, and translate those into what is going to build the best and simplest solution for them. It's really your job, and Palantir does a really good example of very very complex issues and then scaling them down into simple solutions for complex problems that the customer would not have known how to ask for.
下一件事是
我們用5分鐘把這裡講完
能行吧？
好聽取客戶的建議
但不是他們說什麼你就做什麼
這是做企業軟件時很重要的一點
你的客戶可能有很多的要求
你的任務是把這些要求提煉出來用來完成你的產品
但這不是說他們讓你做什麼
你就去做什麼
你要做的事聆聽他們的問題
然後把這些問題
轉化為最好的最簡單的解決方案
Palantir就是​​個很好的例子
他們面臨的情況很複雜
但他們提出了一個非常簡單的解決方案
甚至連他們的用戶也沒有想到
會如此簡單

You want to modularize not customize. So build a platform as opposed to building all the custom technology and customer vertical experiences into the software itself. Make sure you really think about openness and APIs as a way of building experiences. Don't build that directly into the product. Focus on the user always. The magical thing about building an enterprise software company right now is you can keep consumer information at the center of the product. That will always mean that adoption is easier, that your product has a much better chance of going viral. It becomes easier to sell in the organization. Always make sure you bring consumer DNA into the product. Your product should sell itself. But that does not mean you don't need sales people. So this is a really important distinction. Leverage everything about the internet, leverage everything about users to get to your customers. But you still will likely need sales as a way to help your customers navigate your product, help your customers navigate the competitive landscape and ecosystem. So you are going to want very domain specific sales associates that are going to be helpful for your customer in deploying enabled in these positions. But don't make that be a substitute, don't make that be a handicap for not building a great product. So you fundamentally build a product inside that. A company called Mixpanel comes in through the developer and eventually sells to that organization with a more inside sales process. Also read these three books: Crossing the Chasm, the Innovators Dilemma, and Behind the Cloud. These three combined, if you binge and read them all, you will come out ahead.
你要做的是模塊化而非定制化
建立一個平台
而不是把所有定制的技術
以及垂直體驗都直接做到軟件裡面
要確保API的開放性
通過這種方式來提高垂直與定制體驗
而不是直接把它們嵌入產品永遠要考慮用戶
對於企業軟件公司
比較神奇的一件事情就是
你可以在產品中保留品牌基因
這樣就很容易被廣泛接受
你的產品也更有可能進行病毒式傳播
這樣就更容易賣給其他企業了
所以要確保在產品開發的過程中
嵌入品牌的基因
讓你的產品自己給自己宣傳
但這不是說你就不需要銷售人員了
這是一個非常重要的差別
你可以通過互聯網以及用戶
把你的軟件賣給其他潛在的客戶
但同時也需要一些銷售人員
為你的客戶來介紹產品
幫助你的客戶
建立競爭優勢和生態系統
所以你也需要很多
以具體領域為導向的銷售人員
這對於你的客戶在他們的公司中
利用你的軟件發揮更大作用是非常有利的
但千萬不要因為這樣
就放棄了創造一個偉大產品的信念
所以從根本上在產品中傳遞品牌基因是非常重要的
Mixed Panel這個公司面向開發者提供軟件
但隨著時間的推移他們也做了很多
銷售方面的工作
你們也可以讀讀這三本書
《跨越鴻溝》《創新者的窘境》以及《雲攻略》
他們結合了--
如果你把這三本書讀完
你就可以甩開對手
建立一家龐大的軟件公司
So in closing, today, right now is an amazing time to start a software company. I wish you the best of luck. If it doesn't work, we are hiring. The only other thing is, please do not compete with me because I have a lot of competition already. Ideally either come work with us or build your own company.

那麼總結下今天的內容
當你們走出這間教室時
就是一個​​創立一家企業軟件公司的非常好的時機
我在這裡祝大家好運
如果你失敗了我們還在招人來我們這吧
另外給大家的忠告就是別和我競爭
以為和我競爭的已經夠多了
那麼要麼加入我們要麼自己創業
So thank you very much!
